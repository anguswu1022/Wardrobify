## Shoes microservice

Using data pulled from the wardrobe microservice and use it to make the
show microservice.

## Hats microservice


By pulling the data from wardrobe, we were able to create a frontend and backend of a website. Setting up the backend data in order to create a hat and putting it into a list to let our user see it in the frontend.
