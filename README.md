## Design

## Shoes microservice

Using data pulled from the wardrobe microservice and use it to make the
show microservice.

## Hats microservice

Explain your models and integration with the wardrobe
microservice, here.

 By using the data from wardrobe, we were able to create a backend and frontend of a
 website. By taking that information, we were able to create a backend that list, create, and deletes hats. And from that backend, we're able to set it up for our user to see.
