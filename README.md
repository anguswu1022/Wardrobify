## Design

## Shoes microservice

In this fullstack application, I created the front-end with the use of React and the back-end with Django. The Poll application in the shoes microservices gets the Bin data from the wardrobe API and creates/updates a BinVO object in the user's wardrobe. Within the same microservice, the shoes_rest app enables users to create, view, and delete shoe objects within the BinVO. I rendered a interactive single page app with React that allowed users to view, create, and delete the shoe objects using various components.

## Hats microservice


By pulling the data from wardrobe, we were able to create a frontend and backend of a website. Setting up the backend data in order to create a hat and putting it into a list to let our user see it in the frontend.
